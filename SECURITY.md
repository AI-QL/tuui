# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

For general security concerns without critical risks, feel free to submit a regular GitHub issue through: https://github.com/AI-QL/tuui/issues/new/choose

For potential security vulnerabilities requiring confidential handling (especially those with sensitive exploit details), please prioritize private disclosure by contacting maintainers directly via email at <Administrator>contact@aiql.com. Avoid public issue discussions for these cases.

## Security compliance

Project maintainers are quickly addressing reported security vulnerabilities in the project and providing relevant patches.

We report these to the relevant users and handle the correspondence to prevent the issue from recurring.

## Security recommendations

We recommend that users of project sources use the latest version, which addresses possible security vulnerabilities.
